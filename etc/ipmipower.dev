# This device configuration supports power control via the 
# 'ipmipower' utility.
#
# See powerman-devices(7) for more info on running ipmipower under
# powerman.
#
# some IPMI devices require some time for the firmware to
# reload/re-settle itself after a power-off.  A delay of 5 seconds
# seems to work fine pretty well.
#
# off,delay,on used in place of IPMI cycle to ensure full command
# completion before returning to the user.
